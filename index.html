<p>Born and raised in a matrilineal society on the Din√© reservation in northeastern Arizona,
I have been exposed to kinship my entire life. That value is ingrained in every aspect of my life, from
being a mother, to a student, a professional employee and my relationship with food and the environment.
I am a down-to-earth person with a knack for problem-solving.</p>
